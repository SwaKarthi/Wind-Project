This project aims to predict wind turbine power output by integrating advanced machine learning and deep learning methods to optimize energy production and enhance wind farm efficiency. Using historical and real-time data, the project involves comprehensive data preprocessing, including normalization and feature extraction, followed by dimensionality reduction techniques like clustering and principal component analysis (PCA). The model pipeline incorporates first-level models, such as Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and XGBoost, trained with K-Fold cross-validation to generate meta-features. These meta-features are then used to train a second-level Linear Regression model for improved prediction accuracy. Additionally, the project employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in the data, respectively. By combining the strengths of CNNs and RNNs, the hybrid model aims to provide superior predictive performance. Evaluation metrics like RMSE, RÂ², and MAE are used to assess the model's effectiveness. Ultimately, the goal is to deploy the most efficient model for real-time power output prediction, contributing to sustainable energy production and effective wind farm management.
