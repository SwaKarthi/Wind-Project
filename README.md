This project aims to predict wind turbine power output by integrating advanced machine learning and deep learning methods to optimize energy production and enhance wind farm efficiency. Using historical and real-time data, the project involves comprehensive data preprocessing, including normalization and feature extraction, followed by dimensionality reduction techniques like clustering and principal component analysis (PCA). The model pipeline incorporates first-level models, such as Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and XGBoost, trained with K-Fold cross-validation to generate meta-features. These meta-features are then used to train a second-level Linear Regression model for improved prediction accuracy. Additionally, the project employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in the data, respectively. By combining the strengths of CNNs and RNNs, the hybrid model aims to provide superior predictive performance. Evaluation metrics like RMSE, R², and MAE are used to assess the model's effectiveness. Ultimately, the goal is to deploy the most efficient model for real-time power output prediction, contributing to sustainable energy production and effective wind farm management.

**Input Data:** The input data module initializes by loading historical wind turbine data from a CSV file. It prepares the raw dataset for further processing, ensuring that all necessary columns such as 'Date', 'Wind Speed', and 'Power Output' are correctly formatted and accessible for subsequent steps.

•	File Reading: The CSV file (e.g., 'Wind_Turbine_Historical_Data.csv') containing historical wind turbine data is read into memory using Pandas' read_csv function.

•	Data Validation: Validates the dataset to ensure it includes necessary columns ('Date', 'Wind Speed', and 'Power Output') and checks for any data format issues or inconsistencies.

•	Initial Exploration: Conducts an initial exploration to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset, such as its size, columns, and overall data quality.

**Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:** This module focuses on preparing the wind turbine dataset for predictive modelling. It handles data cleaning, normalization, and transformation to make the data suitable for model training.

•	Handling Missing Values: Addresses missing values in the dataset using techniques such as forward filling or interpolation.

•	Date Conversion: Converts the 'Date' column to a datetime format and sets it as the index for time series analysis.

•	Data Smoothing: Applies a rolling window to smooth the data and reduce noise, capturing the underlying trends.

•	Normalization: Normalizes the data using MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler to scale values between 0 and 1, ensuring consistent and effective model training.

**Data Transformation:** The data transformation module prepares the data for machine learning by converting it into a suitable format for the selected model.

•	Sequence Creation: For time series models, transforms the data into sequences of inputs and corresponding outputs, where each input sequence consists of historical wind speed and turbine data, and the output is the power production.

•	Feature Engineering: Creates additional features that might improve model performance, such as wind speed averages or gusts.

**Alarm for Repair:** To enhance operational efficiency and predictive maintenance, the system includes an alarm feature to flag turbines that may need repair.

•	Repair Condition: Define a condition for repair based on the power output. For example, if the actual power output is significantly lower than the theoretical power output by a certain threshold, the turbine may need repair.

•	Repair Flagging: Add a flag to the dataset indicating whether a turbine needs repair.

•	Alarm Generation: Generate an alarm or notification when a turbine is flagged for repair. This can be implemented using automated alerts or a dashboard displaying the status of each turbine.

**Model Building:** The core module constructs and configures the machine learning model for predicting power output. The model architecture includes:

•	Model Choice: Selects an appropriate machine learning model, such as Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT), Random Forest, or LSTM, based on the characteristics of the data.

•	Model Architecture: Defines the architecture of the chosen model, including layers and units. For example, an LSTM model might include LSTM layers followed by dense layers.

•	Model Configuration: Configures the model with appropriate hyperparameters, such as learning rates and activation functions.

**Model Training and Evaluation:** This module trains the model using the preprocessed data and evaluates its performance.

•	Data Splitting: Divides the dataset into training and testing sets, typically using 80% for training and 20% for testing.

•	Training: Feeds the training data into the model and trains it using techniques such as cross-validation to optimize model weights and minimize prediction errors.

•	Evaluation: Assesses model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score to ensure its effectiveness in predicting power output.

**Prediction and Visualization:** After training, this module applies the model to make predictions and visualize the results.

•	Prediction: Uses the trained model to predict power output based on both the training and testing datasets.

•	Visualization: Creates plots to compare predicted power output with actual values over time, allowing for a clear assessment of how well the model captures and forecasts power trends.

**Results and Metrics:** This module interprets and presents the evaluation metrics calculated from the model's predictions.

•	Metrics Analysis: Quantifies model accuracy and performance using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R2 score, providing insights into the model's predictive capabilities.

•	Reporting: Offers detailed reports on model performance, including areas for potential improvement and recommendations for future iterations
